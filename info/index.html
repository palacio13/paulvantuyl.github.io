		<h2>Résumé</h2>

		<p><small><a href="/assets/files/paulvantuyl-resume-160816.pdf">View as PDF</a></small></p>

		<p>I've been working as a designer full time since 2006. While my education was in graphic design for print, the majority of my experience has been in digital formats. I fell in love with the web while in school, and come from the era where you had to be able to both design and develop your work.</p>

		<p>I believe that design isn't merely appearance; it's the combination of form and function working in unison with the goal of creating a positive emotional experience.</p>
