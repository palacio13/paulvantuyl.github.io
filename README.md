# This is the data for my site

It's automagically transformed into static HTML by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll") whenever I push this repo to GitHub.

I've used a CMS or service for as long as I can remember for my site. For what I need, a CMS is generally too much. Plus I'm tired of backing up databases anytime a software upgrade comes along, etc. I learned about Jekyll, and decided I wanted to do the same thing.

To run local:
- Fire up terminal
- Navigate to directory
- Run `npm start` to run SASS compiler
- Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to run Jekyll compiler/webserver

I would be flattered if you wanted to use any of HTML/CSS/LESS. Give me some link back love if you do...
