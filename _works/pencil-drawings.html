<p>I made these pencil drawings while in college. Spending 6 hours a week drawing had great effect on me... The top image is a graphite study of an artist's charcoal drawing, while the skeleton was a prop the teacher brought into class one day. Bret Blevins was his name, I enjoyed his instruction.</p>
