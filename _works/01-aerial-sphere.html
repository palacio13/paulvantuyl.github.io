<p>The Tallwave project for Aerial Sphere had some specific business requirements, and the end work that we produced for them included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A single-page responsive website</li>
  <li>An animated, explanatory video of their technology</li>
  <li>A custom designed Keynote/Powerpoint presentation</li>
  <li>Business blueprints and market plans for the next stage of their company</li>
</ul>

<p>My main roles in the project were visual design, motion graphics, and editing. Over the course of the project I also gave design direction on other aspects, such as UX design and storyboarding for the video.</p>
