<p>I had the opportunity while working at iDC Photo Video to create illustrations for a series of Canon Speedlite training tutorials by Bruce Dorn. Each illustration is a schematic of the lighting layout for each photo created in the tutorial. This is a selection of some of my favorite pieces in the illustrations. You can see the finished videos and photographs from Bruce on <a href="http://www.learn.usa.canon.com/galleries/galleries/tutorials/speedlite_600exrt_pro_applications_gallery.shtml" "Professional Applications of the Speedlite 600EX-RT Training on Canon's Website">Canon's Digital Learning Center</a>.</p>
