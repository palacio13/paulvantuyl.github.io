# This is the data for my site

It's automagically transformed into static HTML by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll") whenever I push this repo to GitHub.

I've used a CMS or service for as long as I can remember for my site. For what I need, a CMS is generally too bloated. Plus I'm tired of backing up databases anytime a software upgrade comes along, etc. I learned about [Tom Preston-Werner's](http://tom.preston-werner.com/ "Tom Preston-Werner") site, and decided I wanted to do the same thing.

Props to [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap "Bootstrap"), whose framework has been put to good use in this project. [David Bushell's](https://github.com/dbushell/Responsive-Off-Canvas-Menu "Responsive Nav") responsive nav work really helped me make my customized vertical/responsive nav. [Packery](https://github.com/metafizzy/packery "Packery") is the bee's knees.
