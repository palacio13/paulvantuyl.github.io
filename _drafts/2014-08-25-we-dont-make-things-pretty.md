In some ways, this post is definitely a rant. It's about being frustrated by an industry-wide misperception. Actually, it's multiple industries that really suffer from this deviation of reality. If I'm honest with myself (and others), I know deep down that there are those of us who perpetuate the problem shamelessly. Here's the deal:

<p class="lead">I may be a designer, but my job isn't to make things <em>pretty</em>. My job is to make sure users are delighted by the product, app, or website they are using.</p>

When something works _right_, when it's intuitive, when it looks good, I've done my job well. When it surprises people. When it does what they expect it to, and doesn't lead them on. Looking good is a part of this process.

#### Honest design vs decoration

Getting the entire equation right. Ikea's build-it-yourself products are a perfect example of something that can have the experience of being halfway designed. The appearance and finished product is great; however the customer's experience of installing one of their items can make you want to punch yourself in the face. I just finished installing a light fixture that should have taken 15 minutes and it took over an hour, due to the need to modify an old mounting bracket since their design was missing 2 holes to make it easier.
