So a friend and I walk into Press Coffee, which is specatularly close to the 29th Drive office. While waiting in line, an older gentlman notices my beard, which at this point is almost long enough to cover my adam's apple. Now, it was quite noisy, and this gentleman had an accent which made him hard to understand at first. I'm quite American in that I only fluently speak American English, so accents are sometimes impossible for me to understand. He commented on my beard, and since I couldn't quite understand, I replied with "Oh, thank you."

He then asked me if "Are you scientist, or artist? Your beard... You must be scientist or artist."
