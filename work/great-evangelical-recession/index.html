		<p>Motion project for author <a href="http://johnsdickerson.com/" title="John S. Dickerson">John S. Dickerson's</a> book, <em>The Great Evangelical Recession</em>. The book cover was already designed by John's publisher, so I used the cover art and fonts as a design cue for the visual style so that the video would be recognizable as belonging to the book. John recorded and provided the voiceover track, as well as selecting the music. I edited the VO, looped certain portions of the music to make it the proper length, and then created the project in Adobe After Effects.</p>
