		<p>Motion project for author <a href="http://johnsdickerson.com/" title="John S. Dickerson">John S. Dickerson's</a> book, <em>The Great Evangelical Recession</em>. The book cover was already designed by John's publisher, so I used it as a  starting point for the visual style. John recorded and provided the voiceover track, as well as selecting the music. I edited the VO, looped certain portions of the music to make it the proper length, and animated the project in Adobe After Effects.</p>
