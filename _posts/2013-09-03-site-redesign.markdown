Today I deployed the newest version of my website to Github. For the past year my site was powered by WordPress; however it was way more firepower than I needed. When all I have is occasional posts and sometimes adding new porfolio/work pages, it doesn't really make a whole lot of sense to be maintaining WP updates, etc. Now it's powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll"), LESS, and love.

Pros:

- Write posts in Markdown
- Git
- Github &hearts;
- Free hosting
- When I notice something not working or that I want to change, I just create a new Issue

Cons:

- I'm probably going to have to host images using something like Dropbox so my repo doesn't get _giant_ \(no biggie\)

While this site redesign might not be fully complete, it's still fun to deploy early and keep working on it &ndash; because, Github.
