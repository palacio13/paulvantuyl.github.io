I've decided to start recording all the little UI failures I experience in software. Mostly because they are funny; having a collection of these is also good for teaching myself about patterns to avoid. The first (which I'm sure I sent out to Twitter) comes from Apple's Messages app: it has to do with poor syncing of the read/unread status of an iMessage. Instead of clearing the unread status of the icon, it displays a negative number. Not sure if this is fixed yet.
