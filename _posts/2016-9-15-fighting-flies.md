I'm always turned off by the way some MMA fighters gloat over their opponents when they get a submission, TKO, or KO. I always think "Have some humility and respect for your opponent!"

The victory dance I just performed after striking down a fly with my bare hands (fully utilizing my Green Belt in Tae-Kwon Do) makes me doubt whether I would be humble myself or not.

PS

Flies are like insect ninjas. Defeating one without a fly swatter is challenging.
