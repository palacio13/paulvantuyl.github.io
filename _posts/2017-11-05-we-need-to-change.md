I know before I even start writing this that some will say, "You should stick to talking about Design." Which is totally absurd, because if any man only discusses that which is in his purview, then what good is he to his community or the world around him?

I identify myself not just as a man, or as a designer, or as a husband or father, but as a Christian, and as an American. And I cannot understand the obsession that other Christian, American men have with firearms and their dogmatic _rights_ that they have to bear arms. They hold to this "right" even in the face of the terrorism and murder of __hundreds__ of innocents and will not cave or give in, even to logic; worse, even to the words of Jesus of Nazareth himself.

Why do we continue to allow those who wish to harm us access to firearms, just so that we may also have them? This is stupidity at best and insanity at worst. We need gun control. More guns will not save us.
