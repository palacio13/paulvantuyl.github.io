I would like to clarify my definition of what it means to be a follower of Jesus. It's unfortunate that it's necessary for me to say this, but currently the general view of Christians in America isn't one of good repute<sup>[1](http://www.unchristian.com/book.asp "Unchristian the Book")</sup>. And it's our fault. 

If you're curious, I fully agree with the statement of faith from [Lumen Deo](http://lumendeo.org/about/confession-of-faith/)

Should I explain the gospel? Or should I insert here a link to a statement of faith. 

There is this spot in the bible where God says that he has a name, and describes himself<sup>[2](href="http://bible.us/59/exo.34.6.esv)</sup> as being merciful, gracious, slow to anger, abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, forgiving, and full of justice. Jesus is all of those things, and I believe that he *is* God.

Being a follower of Jesus *is not* being narrow-minded, spiteful, bitter, spewing hate speech, or hating anyone or any people group. And I feel that when followers of Jesus are associated with these things, that Jesus is misrepresented and dragged through the mud. That's something that fills my heart with grief.
