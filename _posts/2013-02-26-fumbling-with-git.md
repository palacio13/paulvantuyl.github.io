I'm starting to fumble my way around Git. I have to say, Github is making it quite fun \(and easy to learn\). Until recently, I had only used Github for downloading repos and Gists... It's peaked my interest enough that I'm taking a stab at making a couple of Mac utilities. We'll see how this turns out. And if I can make the leap from HTML/PHP/JavaScript to Cocoa.
