A lot of people think that the interface for their product needs to use the same colors as their brand. In reality, the color palette used for a brand (logo, etc) has different goals from a UI, and being forced to use the same palette can be limiting and have unintended consequences. 

Imagine if Ford only made cars that were Ford Blue.
