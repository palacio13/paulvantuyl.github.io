I was listening to a conversation (eavesdropping) about inspiration and thought to myself, "Does inspiration happen more frequently when you’re not as experienced at your craft because it’s easy to have lots of bad ideas?" Then, as you grow in experience and craft, inspiration happens less frequently &ndash; not because you’re having less ideas, or a decrease in inspiration, but because your brain is less receptive to bad ideas. It filters through the cruft more efficiently and rejects the bad ideas before you've had a chance to even register them.

Anyway, just a thought.
