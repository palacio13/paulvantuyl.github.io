		<p>Hi, my name's Paul Van Tuyl. In case you're wondering, it's pronounced <em>Van Tile</em>. I'm a huge nerd who loves designing applications (mobile or SaaS). A few fun facts:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>My wife and I are all about helping kids in foster care</li>
			<li>Currently, we have 3 kids</li>
			<li>We have two large-ish chihuahuas (like giant squirrels)</li>
			<li>I work full-time as the Design Team Lead at <a href="http://tallwave.com/about" title="Tallwave">Tallwave</a> in Scottsdale, AZ</li>
			<li>I freaking love playing <a href="https://www.destinythegame.com">Destiny</a> <i class="far fa-gamepad"></i></li>
		</ul>

		<h3>My personal mission statement</h3>

		<p><em>My professional goal is to use my curiosity, love for design, and craftsmanship to create products, processes, and objects that improve quality of life for human beings.</em></p>

		<h2>Résumé <small><a href="/assets/files/paulvantuyl-resume-160816.pdf" class="iconlink"><i class="far fa-file-pdf"></i></a></small></h2>

		<p>I've been working as a designer full time since 2006. While my education was in graphic design for print, the majority of my experience has been in digital formats. I fell in love with the web while in school, and come from the era where you had to be able to both design and develop your work.</p>

		<p>I believe that design isn't merely appearance; it's the combination of form and function working in unison with the goal of creating a positive emotional experience.</p>
